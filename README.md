# Implementation 
This program runs a version of euchre called "screw the dealer" in which the dealer is forced to choose Trump after 7th move, this program currently does not support the "classic" version or a strategy known as "going-alone"

# Rules
For detailed rules on how to play euchre see https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/ 

# TODO
* Implement an AI to play as players 1, 2, and 3
* Allow support for "classic" mode and "going-alone" gameplay
* Improve the Graphics to keep images centered
* Remove the need to interact with the pygame through the command-line

# Usage
1 Run the main.py file
2 Play the game, following the rules of euchre 

**Keys**
* P: Pass on your move
* T: Call Trump
* **All other instructions will be prompted through the command-line**
